# SLOGO Discussion Refactoring

### Refactoring

*IDEWindow.java
**The main changes to IDEWindow was refactoring duplicate code into helper methods. 
    We created two methods to format the vboxes and hboxes. We also created a method to format
    the ScrollPanes. Additionally, we refactored the code to change how the variables are stores and displayed.
    This aided the functionality for the variables.
*BackEndValProcessor
**It processes angle values and position values in the backend to help with the frontend display functionality.
